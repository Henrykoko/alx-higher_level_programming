  This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. You can find the source code here. The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code The output of the program should be: The number, followed by if the number is greater than 0: is positive if the number is 0: is zero if the number is less than 0: is negative followed by a new line 1-last_digit.c
  Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar three times in your code 5-print_numbers.c

Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All your code should be in the main function 6-print_numberz.c

Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) You can only use putchar twice in your code All your code should be in the main function 7-print_tebahpla.c

Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar twice in your code 8-print_base16.c

Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar three times in your code 9-print_comb.c

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space Numbers should be printed in ascending order You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) All your code should be in the main function You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code You are not allowed to use any variable of type char 10-print_comb2.c

Write a program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code You are not allowed to use any variable of type char All your code should be in the main function 100-print_comb3.c

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space The two digits must be different 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1 Print only the smallest combination of two digits Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code You are not allowed to use any variable of type char All your code should be in the main function 101-print_comb4.c
